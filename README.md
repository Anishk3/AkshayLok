# AkshayLok-Distributing Renewable Energy


##  Abstract
AkshayLok is a Renewable resource management software that uses blockchain technology.We propose a novel decentralized security model between the user and the government. The technology integrates blockchain technology with the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) that allows buyers and sellers of electricity to enter a market long dominated by central power plants and enormous utilities and allows the generators, buyers, and sellers to be able to manoeuvre along the transmission path. This allows renewable energy certification processes to be sped up and automated, as there is greater traceability. This technology also guarantees the transparency and security of the transaction, which remains permanently recorded in the platform, allowing all parties to audit the results. This project alsomakes it possible to work under smart contracts performed automatically when both parties fulfill the agreed terms, thereby cutting out intermediaries and simplifying the process. This reduces costs and increases privacy.

## 1. Introduction
Efficient energy management has never been more crucial than it is today, and renewable energy is undoubtedly the future of the industry. Here Blockchain can change the power balance between consumers and centralized power authorities. The booming market in Distributed Energy Resources (DER) like solar photovoltaic systems (PV), batteries, microgrids, and embedded networks has moved the power balance from central authorities to the edges of the grid, to where citizens have control. And it is not just about controlling the cost of energy consumption, it reflects peopleâ€™s desires that their energy supplies are more sustainable, more socially-responsible, more local, more resilient, and more democratic.

All that is needed to move the revolution into the mainstream is a model for energy trading that takes control out of the hands of central players and puts everyday citizens in charge of a co-created energy future. DISCOMs (distribution companies) will play a key role in the expansion of RTS (roof-top solar
system) as DISCOMs have direct contact with the end user and provide approval for installation, manage the distribution network and also have a billing interface with rooftop owners. We as a DISCOM will be more transparent, secure, and faster than most existing DISCOMS because Existing trading platforms require third-party settlement and reconciliation of millions of transactions between hundreds of thousands of traders across 5-minute trading intervals and a central player is necessary for taking control of all parties data, prescribing fees, requiring trust, proving the accuracy and binding the market up in red tape and bureaucracy.

**The main contributions of this project are threefold as follows:**
- Removing the dependency on big companies and creating a systematic distribution channel for renewable energy.
- Providing everyone with an opportunity to produce renewable energy and sell it to the government.
- Removing the dependency on non-renewable energy.
