# AkshayLok - Distributing Renewable Energy


###  Abstract
AkshayLok is a Renewable resource management software that uses blockchain technology.We propose a novel decentralized security model between the user and the government. The technology integrates blockchain technology with the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) that allows buyers and sellers of electricity to enter a market long dominated by central power plants and enormous utilities and allows the generators, buyers, and sellers to be able to manoeuvre along the transmission path. This allows renewable energy certification processes to be sped up and automated, as there is greater traceability. This technology also guarantees the transparency and security of the transaction, which remains permanently recorded in the platform, allowing all parties to audit the results. This project alsomakes it possible to work under smart contracts performed automatically when both parties fulfill the agreed terms, thereby cutting out intermediaries and simplifying the process. This reduces costs and increases privacy.

## I. Introduction
Efficient energy management has never been more crucial than it is today, and renewable energy is undoubtedly the future of the industry. Here Blockchain can change the power balance between consumers and centralized power authorities. The booming market in Distributed Energy Resources (DER) like solar photovoltaic systems (PV), batteries, microgrids, and embedded networks has moved the power balance from central authorities to the edges of the grid, to where citizens have control. And it is not just about controlling the cost of energy consumption, it reflects people’s desires that their energy supplies are more sustainable, more socially-responsible, more local, more resilient, and more democratic.

All that is needed to move the revolution into the mainstream is a model for energy trading that takes control out of the hands of central players and puts everyday citizens in charge of a co-created energy future. DISCOMs (distribution companies) will play a key role in the expansion of RTS (roof-top solar
system) as DISCOMs have direct contact with the end user and provide approval for installation, manage the distribution network and also have a billing interface with rooftop owners. We as a DISCOM will be more transparent, secure, and faster than most existing DISCOMS because Existing trading platforms require third-party settlement and reconciliation of millions of transactions between hundreds of thousands of traders across 5-minute trading intervals and a central player is necessary for taking control of all parties data, prescribing fees, requiring trust, proving the accuracy and binding the market up in red tape and bureaucracy.

**The main contributions of this project are threefold as follows:**
- Removing the dependency on big companies and creating a systematic distribution channel for renewable energy.
- Providing everyone with an opportunity to produce renewable energy and sell it to the government.
- Removing the dependency on non-renewable energy.

## II. Statement of the Problem and Objectives
India has made great strides in expanding access to electricity in recent years, as more than 130 million people have joined the power grid since 2013. India is the third-largest producer and consumer of electricity worldwide, with an installed power capacity of 404.13 GW as of July 31, 2022, but with electricity demand predicted to triple by 2040 [1], India’s reliance on coal poses a major pollution problem. Despite having the world’s fourth-largest coal reserves, India fell 14 percent short of meeting coal demand in the fiscal year 2016. 

Electricity is an important enabler. The global population is currently electrified to the tune of 84%. To support their development and growing prosperity, advanced and transitional economies require secure access to modern energy sources. Access to affordable and reliable energy is critical in developing countries for reducing poverty, improving health, increasing productivity, increasing competitiveness, and promoting economic growth.

The electricity demand is predicted to triple by 2040 due to Electric vehicles (EVs). The global threshold of Electric Vehicles (EVs) on the road surpassed 1 million in 2015, with the total number closing at 1.26 million. In 2015, there were an estimated 1.45 million electric car charging points worldwide to service this growing fleet. EVs are expected to reach price parity with combustion engine vehicles by 2025, owing to falling battery costs and increased fuel density. EVs will be a major burden to the energy sector. Hence a shift to renewable energy resources is needed. 

Given below is a graph that depicts EV sales in the last three years.

- **Between 2 to 20 million EVs in use worldwide by 2020.**
- **Between 18 to 60 million by 2025.**
- **Between 22 to 140 million by 2030.**

The brisk market for Distributed Energy Resources (DER) such as solar photovoltaic systems (PV), batteries, microgrids, and embedded networks has shifted power away from central authorities and toward the grid's edges, where citizens have control. And it is not just about lowering the cost of energy consumption; it is also a reflection of people's desires for more sustainable, socially responsible, local, resilient, and democratic energy supplies. All that is required to bring the revolution into the mainstream is an energy trading model that removes control from the hands of central players and places ordinary citizens in charge of a co-created energy future


##  III. Background Study and Technology Gaps Identified
Vertically-integrated energy companies sit in the middle of the system, like spiders spinning a web out to the last consumer requesting a connection, they decide where and when to build big powerplants, they decide how to bridge the distance between generators and loads, and they kept the system in balance by applying pressure on the central entity.

While progressive utilities and regulators attempt to position themselves as consumer-focused or consumer-centric, even the most progressive is simply rephrasing a narrative that categorizes citizens as consumers. Consumers are fed a steady diet of price and product while clinging to the umbilicus of the power network. Control, certainty, and economic independence are all costs associated with energy security.

In 2012 in New York City, Hurricane Sandy destroyed the century-old concept of utility power supplies and heralded a new era of distributed energy supplies that value resilience over tradition. An energy supply crunch tied to the war in Ukraine could cause widespread blackouts in the European Union this winter. The world is lacking the infrastructure of proper management of distributed power resources where each consumer can become a retailer. This will not only reduce the dependency on non renewable energy sources but also help a country to become self-reliable in the power sector. There is a dire need for discoms in the renewable energy sector.

The Government of India has laid the baseline for the development of renewable energy. As of July 31, 2022, India’s installed renewable energy capacity (including hydro) stood at 161.29 GW, representing 39.91% of the overall installed power capacity. Solar energy is estimated to contribute 57.97 GW, followed by 40.89 GW from wind power, 10.68 GW from biomass, 4.89 GW from small hydropower, and 46.85 GW from hydropower. 

*But there is no model for the consumer to sell their renewable energy to the grid which will lead to benefits to both parties. Users get one more source of income and the government gets a backup source of energy which will ultimately reduce dependence on non-renewable resources and consumers can get electricity at cheap rates. Companies looking to implement blockchain technology into wholesale electricity distribution focus on connecting end-users with the grid. Blockchain technologies combined with IoT devices enable consumers to trade and purchase energy directly from the grid rather than from retailers.*

## IV. Basic Concepts & Technology
### Blockchain Technology :
Blockchain is a software innovation for establishing digital trust between users facilitating transactions of value, over a network. The blockchain enables trust to be distributed throughout a network, without the need for a central intermediary to track, verify and approve the digital exchange of value. [2] However, this is proving to be expensive, slow, and attackable. By functioning as a decentralized distributed database with a continuously expanding list of entries called blocks, the blockchain solves these problems. While blockchain technology is still in its infancy, existing implementations demonstrate that it has the potential to be better, more efficient, and more secure than current systems. As a result, banks and governments throughout the world are starting to experiment with it.

### Smart Contracts :
On-chain computer code, often known as "Smart Contracts," is a type of computer protocol that eliminates the need for a contractual clause by facilitating, verifying, or enforcing the performance of a contract. The logic of contractual terms is frequently imitated in smart contracts. Smart contracts eliminate the need for a middleman by enabling the transparent, conflict-free exchange of money, assets, shares, and anything else of value. 

A procedure typically entails payment to a middleman, governmental body, bank, attorney, or notary, followed by a processing period before receiving goods or services. However, everything can be automated thanks to smart contract technology. Smart contract technology can be compared to that of an automated vending machine. With a vending machine, money is deposited into the vending machine and the desired item drops for collection provided that the correct amount is deposited. 

Similarly, with a smart contract, funds are deposited into escrow on the blockchain in exchange for the receipt of a transfer of a token (such as a digital certificate of title for a home), which is instantly transferred into a counterparty's hands once conditions are met.Similar to a typical contract, smart contracts specify the terms and conditions of an agreement and also give a means of enforcing those responsibilities.

### IPFS :
The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed file storage protocol that allows computers allover the world to store and serve files as part of a massive peer-to-peer network [3]. Any computer on the planet can download the IPFS software and begin hosting and serving files. If someone installs IPFS on their computer and uploads a file to the IPFS network, that file can be viewed and downloaded by anyone else running IPFS around the world.


## V. Proposed Model / Tool
We as a DISCOM will be more transparent, secure, and faster than most existing DISCOMS because Existing trading platforms require third-party settlement and reconciliation of millions of transactions between hundreds of thousands of traders across 5- minute trading intervals and a central player is necessary for taking control of all parties data, prescribing fees, requiring trust, proving the accuracy and binding the market up in red tape and bureaucracy.

We will use efficient technologies like a distributed ledger and smart grid system [4], which will free up huge corporations from their monopoly and provide regular people the chance to not only become independent but also earn more cash. To maintain the legitimacy of the contract, a smart contract will be created and safely maintained on IPFS, which depends on cryptographic hashes that are simple to put on a blockchain. However, users cannot share files with specific individuals via IPFS.

The strategy we outlined below enables nations wealthy in renewable resources (such as tropical and subtropical nations with easy access to solar energy) to be self-sufficient and independent of traditional energy sources. Additionally, ending the monopoly.

A user will log in to our website using their wallet (metamask), after which they will be prompted to fill out a form clearly stating the terms and conditions laid out by the governing body, and an agreement will be reached between the two parties, which will be publicly available and anyone can look it up. In our backend, after the user submits the form, a smart contract will be created whose information is kept in IPFS, giving us a unique hash that is stored in the blockchain network. Anyone can access the content of the agreement using that hash, which will not only increase transparency but also builds trust between them.

## V. Implementation and Results

### Gathering of Data :
Users enter the required data like their personal details, type of plant (eg:- rooftop solar system), the technology used to generate energy, and average energy generated monthly and annually in the website.

### Preprocessing :
After receiving the details, these details are reviewed by the smart contract. The smart contract checks whether the criteria given by the government both financial and technical are met or not. If the smart contract accepts the information, the digital certificate is signed between the government and the client which is reviewed annually.

### Transactions :
All transactions between the government and client are done through Metamask wallet including the fee generated for deploying the smart contract.

### Data Analysis and Storage:
Entire details of the client as well as the information in the smart contract is stored in the IPFS. IPFSwill generate a unique hash specific to the transaction which will be stored in the blockchain network.

### Web-App Development :
- FrontEnd: 
		For Frontend, we will use HTML5, CSS3, and ReactJS.
- Backend: 
		To develop smart contracts we use Solidity, to connect smart contracts with the frontend we will use EtherJS and NodeJS, to store data we use IPFS, to conduct transactions we use Metamask and all the information will be deployed in the Polygon Network.

### Deployment :
To host the Website, we will be using Heroku.

## VI. Key Findings

- **The Government, on 30th December 2015, approved a program “Grid Connected Rooftop and Small Solar Power Plants Programme‟ for the installation of 4,200 MW RTS plants in the country by the year 2019-20, of which 2,100 MW was through CFA and balance 2,100 MW was without CFA.**
- **It aims to achieve a cumulative capacity of 40,000 MW from Rooftop Solar Projects by the year 2022.**
- **To create an enabling environment for the supply of solar power from rooftops and small plants to the grid.**
- **This scheme is being implemented in the state by distribution companies (DISCOMs).**


## VII. Estimated Benefits to Society and Generation of Income

![Alt text](./Images/img5.JPG?raw=true)


The four major benefits for the energy sector are **:-**
- **Access to Affordable Energy.**
- **Reduced Cost of Utility Bills.**
- **Low Transaction Costs.**
- **New Opportunity for Communication among Energy Devices.**

It gives an additional value proposition that could spur even more investment in distributed renewables and a new era of network management is presented by a network that enables users to derive profit from their DER investment. Ever-increasing levels of automation and resilience will be driven by this new paradigm, not by a few large-scale centralized investments, but by millions of small-scale dispersed investments.

## VI. Conclusion
A decentralized security model for renewable energy management, using the IPFS, has been proposed. Our proposed model makes sure that the excess energy produced by an entity does not go in waste, rather they can monetize that energy by selling it to a merchant. The focus of this project is that blockchain is set to transform the renewable energy industry in many ways from certifying the source of green energy by allocating generation assets to a specific point of consumption to making energy grids more accessible through data-sharing in real-time and through enabling a transaction between two parties.
